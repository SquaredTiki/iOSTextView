# iOS Text View

This is a small app which demonstrates a subclass of `NSTextView` which simulates the interface of a `UITextView` on iOS. It replicates the fading blue cursor as well as the selection thumbs.

# ToDo

- Add loupe overlay for selection adjustment and on long press (WIP) 
- Display basic popup menu on selection with options for copy, cut and paste
- Fix general bugs
